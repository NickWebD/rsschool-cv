## About Me

I became interested in web development when I stumbled upon a course on the basics of HTML. Upon completing it, I was able to build a simple website, sparking a desire to delve deeper into this field. Gradually, I started working on more complex projects, learning something new each time and mastering new technologies and tools.

My goal is to become a highly skilled professional in web development, capable not only of creating functional and aesthetically appealing interfaces but also of applying cutting-edge technologies to solve complex problems.
