## About Me

I became interested in web development when I stumbled upon a course on the basics of HTML. Upon completing it, I was able to build a simple website, sparking a desire to delve deeper into this field. Gradually, I started working on more complex projects, learning something new each time and mastering new technologies and tools.

My goal is to become a highly skilled professional in web development, capable not only of creating functional and aesthetically appealing interfaces but also of applying cutting-edge technologies to solve complex problems.

## Skills

- HTML&CSS
- SASS/SCSS
- Gulp/Pug
- JS
- Git
- Figma, Photoshop

## Code example

Complete the solution so that it returns true if the first argument(string) passed in ends with the 2nd argument (also a string).
Examples:

```
solution('abc', 'bc') // returns true
solution('abc', 'd') // returns false
```

Solution:

```
function solution(str, ending) {
 return str.endsWith(ending);
}
```
